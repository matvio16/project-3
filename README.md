<h1>Project 3</h1>

<h3>Project Overview & Purpose</h3>

The affects of socioeconomic and climate change indicators on GDP per Capita

<h3>Project Instructions</h3>

- You can use this database to analyze if socioeconomic and climate change indicators have an effect on GDP per Capita.​

- We used PETL python library to import the csv file and clean the data​

- From the cleaned data, Pandas DataFrame that was created, can be used to draw analysis and/or create data visualizations

- Also FLASK API can be used to view the dataset and draw analysis as well


<h3>Databases Used and Why</h3>

- We used postgres to create our databases
  
-Since our data wasn't complex, we decided to use postgres over mongoDB and SQLite
