<h3>Project Overview & Purpose</h3>

The affects of socioeconomic and climate change indicators on GDP per Capita

<h3>Project Instructions</h3>

- We used psycopg2 to create the database and tables
- We used Flask API 


<h3>Databases Used and Why</h3>

- We used postgres to create our databases
-Since our data wasn't complex, we decided to use postgres over mongoDB
